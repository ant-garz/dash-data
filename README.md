## üîê HTTPS & Security Notice

This project is developed using HTTP for local development and testing purposes only.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This project is not configured for HTTPS by default.**

- All API traffic in development runs over `http://localhost`.
- Tokens (such as Bearer tokens for authentication) are transmitted in plaintext during local development.
- This setup is intended for **personal, educational, and portfolio use only**, not for deployment in a production environment.

### Recommended for Production Use

If deploying this project publicly, ensure the following:

- Use **HTTPS** with a valid SSL certificate to prevent token leakage and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Ensure proper CORS configuration and CSRF protection for stateful apps.
- Secure `.env` files and database credentials before deploying.

This project prioritizes functionality and developer learning over hardened production security by default.

### If someone wants to use HTTPS locally
- valet secure my-app   # If using Laravel Valet
- use mkcert for local SSL certs

# **‚ö†Ô∏è Production Warning**

 If deploying this project publicly, make sure to:

 - ‚úÖ Use **HTTPS** with a valid SSL certificate to protect user data and authentication tokens.
 - ‚úÖ Secure all environment variables (`.env`) and **never commit them** to version control.
 - ‚úÖ Configure **CORS** properly to control cross-origin access to the API.
 - ‚úÖ Enable **CSRF protection** if your frontend makes state-changing requests (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE).
 - ‚úÖ Sanitize and validate **uploaded video files** to restrict file types (e.g., `.mp4`, `.mov`) and enforce size limits.
 - ‚úÖ Keep **Laravel and dependencies updated** to receive the latest security patches.
 - ‚úÖ Limit database access with least-privilege user roles and secure credentials.
 - ‚úÖ Run `APP_DEBUG=false` and log errors in a non-sensitive way (e.g., Sentry, Laravel logs).
